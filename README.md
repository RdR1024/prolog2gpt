# prolog2gpt
SWI Prolog library to interface to the GPT API.

# Introduction
Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT have greatly advanced natural language processing in recent years.  However, they can benefit from interfacing with other types of reasoning modules, including logic engines (see for example the discussions in "Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning" 2023 by Lyu et al or "FOLIO: Natural Language Reasoning with First-Order Logic" 2022 by Han et al).

Currently, there are interface libraries to GPT for Python and NodeJS, but not Prolog.  The work in this repo seeks to address that gap by building a library for SWI Prolog.
